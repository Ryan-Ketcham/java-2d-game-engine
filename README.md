# 2D Game Engine made in Java
A software-rendered game engine written in Java with full support for lighting/shadows, alpha blending, and SFX.

This project was mostly a follow-along from [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7dwpoQd3a8j6C9p5LqHzYFSkii6iWPZF), with some additional features added such as height levels for lighting and shadows.
